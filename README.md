just made this awsome project  called DEFI trading platform

in this project i have imbedded 4 fake erc-20 tokens named DAI, BAT ,ZRX , REP  made using #OpenZeppelin  in this i have given first four accounts of mine 1 #ethereum  equivalent fake erc-20 tokens 



there is a withdraw and a deposit function by withdraw button you can invest fake #crypto tokens present in your account to the trading application and by depositing you can deposit the tokens earned to your account 



also there is a function called limit order and market order 

limit order basically means that you want to buy or sell n number of tokens at this highest price that you will put in the input field 



market orders means that you want to buy or sell n number of tokens what ever price that is availiable in the market



the trading algorithm matches  the limit order and the market orders and create a trade between the tokens and price that person who wants the tokens at any price get the tokens and the person who wants to sell at a specific price sells it so its all about the working of this DAPP



I have followed Julien Klepatch tutorial series avaliable on 

https://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/ this website 



thanks Julien Klepatch for making this awsome course on decentralized applications using ethereum and soldity you are great teacher and an awsome person
